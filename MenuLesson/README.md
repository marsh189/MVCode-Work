# Top Down Shooter Lesson

A game I created to make a lesson for students learning Unity can attempt to recreate. What the learn includes:

- How to make menus with the Unity UI system. (Main Menu, Pause Menu, Game Over Menu)
- Moving a simple circle sprite around using the arrow keys.
- Shooting projectiles in the direction of the mouse.
- Collision Detection
- Health System
