# Top Down Shooter Lesson

A game I created to make a lesson for students learning Unity can attempt to recreate. What they learn includes:

- How to make menus with the Unity UI system. (Main Menu, Pause Menu, Game Over Menu)
- Moving a simple circle sprite around using the arrow keys.
- Shooting projectiles in the direction of the mouse.
- Enemy wave system that gets harder as they move further into the game.
- Enemy spawn locations that are randomly chosen to spawn an enemy.
- Making the enemies move towards the player.
- Collision Detection
- Health System
